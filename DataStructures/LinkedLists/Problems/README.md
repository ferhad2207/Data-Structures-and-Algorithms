   - Inserting new Node(or element) to sorted LinkedList by keeping order
   - Reversing LinkedList both iteratively and recursively
   - Displaying(or printing) LinkedList from end
   - Finding length of the LinkedList is even or odd
   - Merging 2 LinkedLists into third LinkedList in sorted order both iteratively and recursively
   - Reversing LinkedList in pairs both iteratively and recursively
   - Splitting Circular LinkedList into 2 equal Circular LinkedLists
   - Reversing k Nodes of LinkedList Recursively, (k > 0)
   - Rotating the LinkedList to the right by k places
   - Finding the last Node from beginning whose n%k==0, where n is the number of Nodes and k is a constant integer
   - Removing duplicates from the LinkedList
   - Removes duplicates from the LinkedList using HashTable for increasing efficiency
   - Filtering even and odd numbers of LinkedList
   - Returning common elements from 2 different sorted LinkedLists
