 * @author Ferhad Mehdizade
 * Implementation of Doubly LinkedList
 * Insert O(n) (in case of inserting to beginning time complexity is O(1))
 * Delete O(n) (in case of deleting from beginning time complexity is O(1))
 * Access O(n)
 * Search O(n)
 * Good for insertion and deletion process as the Singly LinkedList. But the advantage of a doubly linked list (also
        called two â€“ way linked list) is that given a node in the list, we can navigate in both directions.
 * But each node requires an extra pointer, requiring more space
 * Insertion or deletion of a node takes a bit longer
