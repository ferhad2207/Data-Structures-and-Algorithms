 * Implementation of Circular LinkedList
 * Insert O(n) (in case of inserting to beginning time complexity is O(1))
 * Delete O(n) (in case of deleting from beginning time complexity is O(1))
 * Access O(n)
 * Search O(n)
 * Good for insertion and deletion process. A circular linked list is a variation of a linked list in which the last node
 *      points to the first node, completing a full circle of nodes. In other words, this variation of the linked list
 *      doesn't have a null element at the end.
