A circular linked list is a variation of a linked list in which the last node points to the first node, completing
a full circle of nodes. In other words, this variation of the linked list doesn't have a null element at the end.

Good for insertion, deletion process and this is very useful in the implementation of the queue data structure.

Insert O(n) (in case of inserting to beginning time complexity is O(1))
 * Delete O(n) (in case of deleting from beginning time complexity is O(1))
 * Access O(n)
 * Search O(n)
