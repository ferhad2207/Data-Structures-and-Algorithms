**A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail). Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list.**

*Good for insertion and deletion process.*

```
Insert O(n) (in case of inserting to beginning time complexity is O(1))
Delete O(n) (in case of deleting from beginning time complexity is O(1))
Access O(n)
Search O(n)
```
