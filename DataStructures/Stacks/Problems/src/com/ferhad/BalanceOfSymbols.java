 * Stacks can be used to check whether the given expression has balanced symbols
 * This algorithm is very useful in compilers
 * Characters such as (, {, [ can be checked is closed with ), }, ] or not, after a lot of text patterns
 * if (isEmpty()) { System.out.println("It is empty"); }    ==>     Valid pattern
 * if (isEmpty() { System.out.println("It is empty); }      ==>     Invalid pattern(compiler gives error)
