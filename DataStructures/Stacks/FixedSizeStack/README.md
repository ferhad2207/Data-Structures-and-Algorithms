# Stack implementation by using static array
The most basic implementation of Stack Data Structure

### Performance
```
Space Complexity - O(n) for n push operations
```

```
Time Complexity
Push - O(1)
Pop - O(1)
Peek - O(1)
```

### Limitations
The maximum size of the Stack must first be defined and it cannot be changed. Trying to push a new element into a full stack causes Exception
