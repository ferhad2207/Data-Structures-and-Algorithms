**Backtracking is an improvement of the brute force approach.** It systematically searches for a
  solution to a problem among all available options. In backtracking, we start with one possible
  option out of many available options and try to solve the problem if we are able to solve the
  problem with the selected move then we will print the solution else we will backtrack and select
  some other option and try to solve it. If none if the options work out we will claim that there is no
  solution for the problem.
